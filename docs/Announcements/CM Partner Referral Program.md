# CM Partner Referral Program

### \*Effective 08/28/2024

## Consideration of Exceptional Talent

Please be informed, **CCC is _always_ hiring new Case Managers**!

To date, we have had incredible results onboarding new CMs who were referred to CCC by existing CMs. This practice
creates a chain of support from friends and family who are already experienced with CCC's Policies and Procedures,
enabling them to assist their referrals, resulting in a smoother transition into the role.

:::tip Notice!

For a limited time, referring CMs will receive a $500 Instant Referral Bonus upon completion of newly contracted CM
Training along with a $500 Delayed Referral Bonus upon completion of 3 full billing cycles, totaling up to $1,000 per
successful referral.

:::

Spread the word! Invite your most qualified friends and/or family to CCC and let's build together as one big happy family in
support of our rich and diverse communities.

To apply, please have the prospect email @CA Care Coordinators HR at hr@joinccc.org attached with a resum√© to join CCC
as a Housing Case Manager.
