### Consideration of Exceptional Talent

Please be informed, **CCC is _always_ hiring new Case Managers**!

To date, we have had incredible results onboarding new CMs who were referred to CCC by existing CMs. This practice
creates a chain of support from friends and family who are already experienced with CCC's Policies and Procedures,
enabling them to assist their referrals, resulting in a smoother transition into the role.

**CCC is offering a $500 Referral Bonus to the referring CM if the referred CM establishes 3 full billing cycles with
CCC.** There is no limit to the number of Referrals you may provide.

Spread the word! Invite your most qualified friends and/or family to CCC and let's build together as one big happy family in
support of our rich and diverse communities.

To apply, please have the prospect email @CA Care Coordinators HR at hr@joinccc.org attached with a resum√© to join CCC
as a Housing Case Manager.
