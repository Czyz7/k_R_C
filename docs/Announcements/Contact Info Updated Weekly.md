# Contact Info Updated Weekly

### \*Effective 12/28/2024

<br></br>

Please be advised, CCC now updates member contact information twice weekly while checking for member eligibility.

If there is a new phone number reporting in the member's IEHP profile, Adrian will update the Personal Information section
of CP on your behalf and notify you via email.

There is no need to contact Reception for updated numbers any longer since you may now assume all available numbers
are current company-wide. This includes the Referral queue. If none of the available numbers work, please reach out to the
referring PCP provided in member's original Navigation Referral (authorization).

When discovering a new phone number for a potential member in the Referral queue who we are having trouble reaching,
Adrian will update the file and notify the general Intake inbox. Intake Strategists, please make sure you have access to the
Intake inbox with notifications ON. For access, email Nicolas.
