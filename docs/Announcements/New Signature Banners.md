# New Signature Banners

### \*Effective 09/04/2024

Attached you may find a ZIP file containing all of your signature banners. The banners are developed to ensure a
high standard of image quality and are therefore oversized.

:::info You must resize yours during setup process to achieve our intended aesthetic. When setting up your banner, please follow the steps below:

1. Open ZIP File and locate your banner

2. Save your banner to desktop

3. In desktop Outlook, tap the settings icon at the top right

4. Select 'Compose and Reply'

5. Select "+ New Signature"

6. Title your new signature "CCC Banner Signature"

7. Upload your banner in the text box

8. Resize your banner to fit the text box by clicking on the image and using any of the **`corner bubbles`** to drag. Be
   sure to fit the banner inside the text box in its entirety. See image attached for example. **`Be sure to drag from
the corner bubbles ONLY.`**

9. Click Save

10. Underneath the text box, where it says "Select default signatures" make sure both drop down boxes say "CCC
    Banner Signature"

11. Compose new email with new resized banner

12. Send email to yourself

13. Access the email in your phone

14. Save new banner to camera roll

15. Open mobile Outlook app

16. Find settings and repeat process (you shouldn't need to resize it again)
