# CM Virtual Assistant Incentive

### \*Effective 12/12/2024

<br></br>

I am excited to announce CCC's Virtual Assistant Incentive for our top performing HCMs.

CCC will be offering the opportunity for HCMs who display outstanding effort, production and availability to be rewarded with a
dedicated, full-time Virtual Assistant (VA).

This benefit will allow selected HCMs the opportunity to increase their Housing Navigation Caseload CAPACITY (not to be confused with Caseload Limit) to 200 members.

Once an HCMs Caseload CAPACITY is upgraded to 200 members, they would be required to continue collecting Good
Points in order to increase their Caseload Limit to the CAPACITY of 200 members.

<br></br>

:::tip Requirements:

- HCM has completed a minimum of 3 full billing cycles with CCC
- HCM has maxed out Housing Navigation caseload to 100 members
- HCM satisfied key metrics as deemed outstanding by CCC leadership

:::

<br></br>

Selected HCMs will have the opportunity to interview and select a VA candidate from a pre-approved pool of candidates.

If two or more HCMs select the same candidate, it will be up to the candidate to choose the HCM they feel most compatible with.

<br></br>

:::info The following HCMs have been selected to participate in CCC's VA Incentive:

- Magaly Munoz
- Luke Walsh
- Rose Gurrier
- Diana Pimentel

:::

<br></br>

HCMs are responsible for assuming the cost of their VAs compensation.

The compensation amount will be disclosed to HCMs once selected for the opportunity.

It is worth noting that the cost is minimal compared to the expecte income our VA Incentive would generate.

Selected HCMs may opt out of the opportunity should they wish to do so.

Congratulations to our selected batch of HCMs!
