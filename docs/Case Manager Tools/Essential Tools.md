### Tips and Tricks

(MDX)

Microsoft Outlook: For now, its advised to use the browser version of outlook. That version crashes less and is can be much faster/responsive.

RingCentral: Download the app for your laptop/desktop! You'll notice a far greater range of use and functionality. Be sure to turn the AI settings on!

Even if you don't use it for every call, it sure can be useful every now and again.

Plaid: Setup Multi-Factor Authentication and set it as a requirement for each time you log in.

Outside of this being considered a best practice, that extra layer of security is worth the time and effort to ensure our members information is safeguarded.
