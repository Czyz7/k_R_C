### Tips and Tricks

<br></br>

<Highlight color="#0433ff">Microsoft Outlook</Highlight>: For now, its advised
to use the browser version of outlook. That version crashes less and is can be
much faster/responsive.

<Highlight color="#ff9300">RingCentral</Highlight>: Download the app for your
laptop/desktop! You'll notice a far greater range of use and functionality. Be
sure to turn the AI settings on!

Even if you don't use it for every call, it sure can be useful every now and again.

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Plaid</Highlight>: Setup Multi-Factor Authentication
and set it as a requirement for each time you log in.

Outside of this being considered a best practice, that extra layer of security is worth the time and effort to ensure our members information is safeguarded.
