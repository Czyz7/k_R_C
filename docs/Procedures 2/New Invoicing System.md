## Rules

### Invoice Amounts

:::warning Notice

Due to a very specific bookkeeping automated rule in place, @CCC Payables Department will deny all invoices
in the amounts of exactly $3,000 and $5,000

If you have an invoice for equal to the mentioned amounts, please add 1 dollar to the invoice, totaling $3,001 or
$5,001

:::

<br></br>

The minimum required invoice amount for a New Billing Request should be no less than
$1,000.00

Please do not Invoice CCC until you have accrued a total of at least $1,000.00 in Accounts Receivable.

This applies to Navigation/Sustaining invoices ONLY and does not apply to any qualifying Zelle reimbursements such
as Intakes or any small refundable expenses incurred while providing HCM services.

### Invoice Submissions

Please be advised, as of the week of Monday, March 3rd, 2025, HCM Invoices are limited to a maximum of two (2)
submission per week. We ask that you submit no more than two (2) invoices weekly to avoid creating a backlog of
invoices for @CCC Payables Department

A week, as defined within the context of this procedure, is considered Monday-Sunday.

### Zelle

Please be informed that as of today, March 14th, 2024, CCC will no longer be processing invoices via Zelle. We have reached a point where our monthly payroll amount exceeds our monthly Zelle limit.
Moving forward, and until further notice, CCC Payables will be processing invoices via ACH Direct Deposit. The information you provide must match your W-9 on file.

For new hires, a voided check must be submitted to HR (this will be requested when the new HCM is hired). If you do not have a voided check, the first page of your most recent bank statement showing your account number and your name will suffice in lieu. We are not interested in seeing your transactions.
