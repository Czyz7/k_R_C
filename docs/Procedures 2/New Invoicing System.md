:::tip Notice

Due to a very specific bookkeeping automated rule in place, @CCC Payables Department will deny all invoices
in the amounts of exactly $3,000 and $5,000

If you have an invoice for equal to the mentioned amounts, please add 1 dollar to the invoice, totaling $3,001 or
$5,001

:::

The minimum required invoice amount for a New Billing Request should be no less than
$1,000.00

Please do not Invoice CCC until you have accrued a total of at least $1,000.00 in Accounts Receivable.

This applies to Navigation/Sustaining invoices ONLY and does not apply to any qualifying Zelle reimbursements such
as Intakes or any small refundable expenses incurred while providing HCM services.
