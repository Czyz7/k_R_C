## Payee and VOO Information

Please use the updated DAR Template herein moving forward. We have added Payee at the bottom. By adding
Payee to DAR Template, we are helping you clearly identify your Payee. Many of the Underwriting Kickbacks we are
experiencing are due to CMs failing to properly narrow down their Payee and subsequently failing to provide
accurate supporting documentation due to a cloud of confusion, causing delayed approvals and avoidable
inefficiencies.

:::info **It all begins with the Owner on VOO**

\*\*- IF Payee = Owner, THEN obtain matching W9 + Voided (if DDAF) OR RAF matching Owner.

- IF Payee = PM, THEN obtain PMA + W9 + Voided (if DDAF) OR RAF matching PM.

- IF Payee = PM = Owner (PM Owns Building Directly) THEN obtain W9 + Voided (if DDAF) OR RAF matching
  Owner/PM. No PMA necessary.\*\*

:::

RAF is the alternative to DDAF and does not require a Voided Check or similar proof of account holder name and
account/routing number information. However, we are offering DDAF first! If DDAF refused, then-and-only-then
may RAF be conceded by CM. This policy is enforced by Quality Control while monitoring calls.

Reminder: Payee should not be confused for Recipient. A Recipient is simply an individual authorized to receive a
physical check via Fedex or similar. Recipients only appear when RAF is utilized as payment method and do not apply
to DDAF. A Payee is universal for both DDAF and RAF. When DDAF, Payee must appear on Voided Check or similar.
When RAF, Payee is the name which appears on the 'Pay To The Order Of' line on CCC's physical check to LL/PM.

I would like everyone to clearly identify your **Payee** and collect the appropriate supporting documentation for
improved continuity with DAR submissions.

## Master Procedure

The following is your Master Procedure for submitting the all-important Deposit Authorization Request (DAR).
Please take your time to thoroughly review and understand the Requirements prior to submitting. Casually
produced, sub-standard DAR submissions are heavily frowned upon and may be avoided by ensuring you have met
all Requirements before submitting. Additionally, moving forward, please use the new DAR Template provided
underneath.

:::info Requirements:

- No Previous History with Subject Address: Member must not have any previous history or association with
  the proposed subject property. You will be notified should the member be confirmed to have had previous
  history associated with the address. Members moving from one unit to another within the same address do
  not qualify for Security Deposit Voucher.

- 3x Rent Limit: Total amount of funding for Security Deposit Voucher must not exceed 3x proposed Monthly
  Rent.

- Private Landlord $3k Limit: Total amount of funding for Security Deposit Voucher must not exceed $3,000 if
  owner is registered as a private individual or trust. This rule qualifies for an exception if member is entering
  tenancy using a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher as CCC may confidently rely on The Housing Authority's
  physical inspection and verified legitimacy of the landlord and property.

- Lease Agreement Dated Under 30 Days: Lease Agreement must be dated within 30 days of DAR submission.

- Move-In Date: Must be dated as of the date of DAR submission aka "today's date" regardless of actual move-
  in date.

- Verification of Ownership (VOO) and Verification of Identity (VOI): Must complete Plaid (VOI) AND Property
  Shark OR Ownerly (VOO) regardless of Security Deposit Voucher Total. VOO and VOI no longer waived if Total
  Amount under $3k. If VOO is satisfied and owner is a business entity such as an LLC or Corporation, must
  provide SOS Business Search as VOI.

- IRS Form W9 Signed and Dated: Must match Bank Account Holder's information along with owner's
  information on VOO. If paying a Property Manager instead, must provide Property Management Agreement
  (PMA) between Owner and Property Management Company.

- Property Management Agreement (PMA): If Owner is different from Payee.

- ATTN Billing/AP Note in Carepatron (CP): Include ONLY Breakdown of Individual Costs AND Total of Individual
  Costs AND Payee Name. Do not include payee banking information. Must match Cost Breakdown within DAR
  submission.

- Direct Deposit Authorization Form (DDAF) + Proof: Provide completed, signed and dated DDAF along with
  Voided Check OR Deposit Slip OR Bank Statement OR Bank Letter. Whichever you provide must include
  Account Holder Name in Full, Routing Number (non-wire) and Account Number.

- Proof-of-Income (POI): Provide POI to ensure member is able to sustain tenancy after being housed. Refer to
  email titled '[POLICY] Proof-of-Income Required' for more detailed instructions.

- DAR Attachments and CP Uploads Matching: Ensure all attachments provided within DAR email are included
  within CP Notes. DAR Email attachments and CP attachments must always mirror one-another.
