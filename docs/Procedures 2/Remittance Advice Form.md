# Remittance Advice Form

### \*Effective 10/15/2024

## Procedure

The following is CCC's official procedure for the **Remittance Advice Form (RAF)** which is required if a Property
Manager or Property Management Company refuses to complete a Direct Deposit Authorization Form (DDAF).

If DDAF is refused, please have PM fill out RAF in lieu of DDAF in order for CCC to obtain the most accurate and
reliable delivery information for recipient. Please note, recipient must designate one individual to sign the parcel at
time of delivery, otherwise delivery will be denied.

(MDX)

DDAF must be presented to PMs initially with no mention of RAF. If DDAF is refused, then and only then may RAF
be introduced.

DDAF is a hard requirement for Private Landlords with no exceptions. RAF is valid for Property Management
Companies only.

:::info Please be advised

RAF is now available for Private Landlords who refuse DDAF. It is imperative that DDAF is presented to Private
Landlords first, prior to offering RAF.

Payee must match Owner on VOO if paying Private LL. Different Individual Payee cannot be designated by Private
LL. Only Property Management Company may be designated as Payee by Private LL with valid PMA.
