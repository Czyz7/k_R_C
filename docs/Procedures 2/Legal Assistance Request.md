# Legal Assistance Request

### \*Effective 02/27/2025

### Appreciation

I am excited to announce that we have developed a Procedure to support members dealing with legal issues, such
as active and ongoing eviction proceedings. If you have a member that might benefit from legal administrative
assistance, please proceed with the procedure template below to receive a CCC Legal Strategist assigned to your
member's case. If approved, you may collaborate with the CCC Legal Strategist assigned to assist your member with
ongoing legal concerns for as long as necessary.

A very big shout out to **`@Graciela Romero`** for being CCC's first Legal Strategist and making this initiative possible.

## Required Documents

Please refer to the requirements below when submitting a Legal Assistance Request. Be sure to gather all necessary
documents for our Legal Strategists prior to submitting a Legal Assistance Request. All required documents must be
uploaded to Carepatron and attached to the Legal Assistance Request email for review, along with the Verbal
Disclosure recording.

sure to record the verbal consent of your member and upload the MP3 recording into the member's CarePatron

"I want to inform you that this verbal disclosure is being recorded. May I please have you state your name and date
of birth? Thank you.

Please be advised that CCC's Legal Assistance services should not be considered as official legal advice nor representation.

Your assigned Legal Strategist is a trained specialist tasked to assist you administratively with specific legal matters
and should not be mistaken as your lawyer, counselor or legal representative.

You should not expect your assigned Legal Strategist to represent you in a court of law or provide you with official legal advice.

CCC will not be held liable for any legal outcomes should you choose not to seek official legal representation by a

California Board Certified Lawyer or Legal Representative.

By submitting this application, you are not guaranteed to be assigned a Legal Strategist.

All cases are subject for review on a first-come-first-served basis. If you agree and accept these terms, please say "YES".
