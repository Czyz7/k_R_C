# AOR/POA Authorization Request

### \*Effective 10/28/2024

The following is your Official Procedure for 3rd party callers inquiring on behalf of an applicant to either help a
member join the program, or request updates on behalf of an applicant. `You must establish AOR/POA Authorization
to provide information to 3rd party callers.`

**AOR** = Agent of Record

**POA** = Power of Attorney

:::note Procedure

**`Step 1:`** **Initial Caller Identification**

- Ask for the 3rd party representative's name, phone number, and relationship to the member.
- Obtain applicant member's name and IEHP ID. Check if applicant member is eligible with IEHP and does not
  have an active referral status with CCC. If eligible, proceed to the next step. If member is actively receiving
  services from CCC, connect to assigned CM.

**`Step 2:`** **Verify Power of Attorney or Agent of Record**

- Inquire if the caller has documentation of the Power of Attorney or Agent of Record.

- If AOR/POA documentation is available, request that they email it to **reception@joinccc.org** with the subject
  line: **[AOR/POA Verification for IEHP's Member Name].**

- Inform the caller that we will wait for the AOR/POA verification. Once received, we will submit it to IEHP for
  verification and authorization.

- Once we receive approval from IEHP to proceed with the pre-assessment, we will contact AOR/POA back for
  continued support.

**`Step 3:`** **Submit AOR/POA Authorization Request to Authorizations Department**
