# Carepatron Date Tags

### \*Effective 03/11/2025

<br></br>

As per the @CCC Billing Department's request, please do not add or remove any "date tags" in Carepatron. These tags are only to be managed by the Billing Department and no one else.

Additionally, if the member hasn't received sustaining approval yet, please refrain from adding or changing any tags (Navigation, Deposit, Sustaining), except for intake strategists, who can change tags as usual when doing intake assessment.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
