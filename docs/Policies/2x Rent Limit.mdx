Please be advised, as of July 1st, 2024 <Highlight color="#ff2600">CCC WILL NO LONGER PROVIDE LAST MONTH'S RENT</Highlight> due to new State Legislation
called `Assembly Bill 12`.

**Lease Agreements dated 07/01/24 or later may include no more than Security Deposit (not to exceed 1x rent) and First
