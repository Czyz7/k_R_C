Unfortunately, due to the sensitive and nuanced nature of our services coupled with the dire circumstances of our
members, and at times, the bad faith of those who wish to take advantage of our resources, difficult moments may arise as
part of your experience when working with members.

It goes without saying that CCC team members are likewise prohibited from using profanity or any other language deemed
unprofessional or inappropriate.
