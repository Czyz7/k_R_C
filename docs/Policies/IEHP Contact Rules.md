We have advised IEHP to inform us if CCC partners or employees contact IEHP Provider Services or Housing
Department. If we are informed you have contacted IEHP Provider Services or Housing Department, or if Quality
Control reports to Upper Management of an incident, disciplinary action will be taken.

To be clear, you may assist the member to reach IEHP Member Services, however, you are not to provide an NPI
Number or Tax ID Number if you are transferred to IEHP Provider Services or IEHP Housing Department. You must
advise the requesting representative that you are unauthorized to provide the information requested if ever you are
asked for CCC's NPI or Tax ID.

:::danger DO NOT PROVIDE CCC's NPI OR TAX ID

If a member wishes to speak with IEHP Housing Department, they are within their rights to do so, but you may only
advise them how to be in contact with IEHP Housing. You are unauthorized to call them yourself or with the
member on the phone. The member would need to seek IEHP Housing independently.

You may call IEHP Member Services with the member, but not IEHP Provider Services or IEHP Housing Department.
If you are transferred by IEHP Member Services to IEHP Provider Services or IEHP Housing, you must not proceed
with the call and are required to provide instructions to the Member regarding how to contact IEHP Housing
independently.

If you have been contacting IEHP Provider Services or IEHP Housing in the past, it is okay, as this Policy is official as
of today. Previously, this was not an issue. Due to our growth and the growth of IEHP Housing as a whole, this is now
becoming an issue for IEHP's Housing Team.
