# New CM Probation Period

### \*Effective 08/28/2024

<br></br>

The following is CCC's Official Policy for New CMs regarding your Initial Probationary Period. CCC expects New CMs to
**THOROUGLY** read through all provided materials, specifically, `Policies/Procedures/Announcements`, prior to accepting New
Members.

Should a New CM complete training and still feel uncertain or insecure in your confidence of understanding our
workflows, you are welcome to request another round of training from HR prior to becoming activated.

<br></br>

:::info Once officially activated, you will be held accountable to the following requirements:

- New CMs will be on a **30-Day Probationary Period** beginning as of the date they are officially activated after
  completing required training and shadowing sessions.

- New CMs will be held to a **12 Bad Point Allowance** as of their **First 30 Days**. If New CMs surpass 12 Bad Points within
  initial 30-Days, there is an overwhelmingly high chance of Contract Termination or a Severely Decreased Caseload. 6
  Bad Point Allowance will replace 12 Bad Point Allowance after initial 30 days.

Be advised, New CMs are expected to start off on the right foot, quickly. Slow starters will not be tolerated or welcomed.
Many of our New CMs are demonstrating the ability to meet minimum requirements on their very first day and onward.
Surviving your first 30 days will rely heavily on effort. We do not expect you to know everything on Day 1, but we do expect
you to display independence, activity and effort. There are mild challenges in achieving 2 Hours in your first week
especially, due to not yet having a full caseload of members to reach out to, but you may use this opportunity to reach out
to Landlords, Property Managers, Residential Complexes, Community Based Organizations, Shelters, Programs, Charities,
Experienced CMs, Supervisors or other related parties in effort to seek assistance or establish beneficial networks,
relationships and benefits for yourselves and your members. Forging valuable referral networks and housing resource
partnerships with property owners is essential for accelerated success.

We are not seeking excuses; we are seeking highly motivated and independent individuals capable of navigating self-
sufficiently. Ultimately, these requirements have been proven to be possible by many New CMs who have grown their
caseloads and career with CCC into a highly beneficial opportunity. You will reap exactly what you sew into your
partnership with CCC. A successful Housing Case Manager is resourceful, ambitious, savvy, self-driven, attentive to detail,
entrepreneurial and has powerful work ethic.

You are welcome to reach out to the CM Group Chat in RingCentral (RC), The Training Team, your referring CM (if
applicable) or your direct Supervisors for advice or guidance. However, please be mindful of everyone's time, as we are all
extremely busy and most of us wear more than 1 hat; being in charge of multiple departments, cases, positions,
responsibilities and people. Be sure your question is not answered in `Policies/Procedures/Announcements` prior to
reaching out. Your source materials, along with the CM Group Chat is the most respectful initial approach that should be
attempted prior to escalating your question.

I wish you good luck in your partnership with CCC. Stay focused, driven and ambitious during this time. Like any great
opportunity, the beginning is the most challenging and only the most capable will be worthy of changing theirs, and their
member's lives.
