# 2x Rent Limit

### \*Effective 06/24/2024

(MDX)

Please be advised, as of July 1st, 2024 CCC WILL NO LONGER PROVIDE LAST MONTH'S RENT due to new State Legislation
called `Assembly Bill 12`.

**Lease Agreements dated 07/01/24 or later may include no more than Security Deposit (not to exceed 1x rent) and First
Month's Rent ONLY.**

CCC's previous 3x Rent Limit is now officially the **2x Rent Limit**. Future DAR submission must not exceed 2x Rent in total.
