# Accurate Invoicing Point System

### \*Effective Immediately 12/04/2024

CCC is now implementing a point system for Invoicing @CCC Payables Department to
maximize the team's efficiency and further optimize payment turnaround times.

We have been experiencing contractors submitting duplicate claims, premature claims, failing to follow Careplan
dates, prorating inaccurately, and other such impurities. Any imperfect invoices will be assessed Bad Points.

(MDX)

Duplicate: 2 Bad Points
Advanced Billing: 1 Bad Point
Disregarding Careplan Date: 0.5 Bad Point
Incorrect Proration: 0.5 Bad Point
Perfect Submission: 0.5 Good Point
