# Monitoring/Recording Disclosure

### \*Effective Immediately 11/04/2024

<br></br>

All calls are now not only monitored, but also recorded. To ensure compliance, it is

<Highlight color="#ff2600">MANDATORY</Highlight> for ALL CCC Team Members taking
or making a call to provide the following disclosure:

"Please be advised that this call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance purposes."

You must provide the above disclosure at the beginning of ALL Incoming or Outgoing calls. If a new caller joins an
ongoing call in which the Disclosure was already provided, a new Disclosure must be provided to the newly joining
party. The Disclosure must be verbally read at the beginning of each new call, each time, without exception.
Monitoring/Recording Disclosure does not have to be mentioned for Internal calls with CCC Team Members unless
there is a third party also on the call.

Failure to provide Monitoring/Recording Disclosure at the beginning of ALL calls will result in disciplinary actions.
This Policy, like all PPAs (Policies/Procedures/Announcements) are being actively monitored and enforced by CCC's
Quality Control Department.

We appreciate your cooperation in helping CCC stay compliant with call-center regulations.

Monitoring/Recording Disclosure must be read to natural human beings who are not affiliated team members of
CCC. Voicemail greetings and automated systems do not require Monitoring/Recording Disclosure to be read.
