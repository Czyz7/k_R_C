# Underwriting: Internal-Only Department

### \*Effective Immediately 03/07/2024

Please be advised, CCC's Underwriting Department is Internal-Only and does not interface with members directly. CCC
team members are prohibited from transferring calls to individual Underwriters or the Underwriting Department.
Members may speak with your direct Supervisor, if applicable, but not Underwriting. Also note that blind transfers to
Supervisors are strictly prohibited. Escalation calls with Supervisors must be scheduled in advance and cannot be taken
during the call.

If faced with pushback by a member during relaying a request made by Underwriting:

<br></br>

:::info **HEAR MEMBER THOROUGLY and say...**

```
"I understand your perspective and empathize with you completely, but as a Housing Case Manager,
I'm only able to provide you with the information I am provided. Unfortunately, Underwriting is
an internal-only department and does not speak with members directly. I'm here to do my best to
advocate on your behalf, but I'm limited once we enter this stage of the process."

```

The chances of experiencing difficulties with a member may be increased when submitting a Deposit Authorization Request
and entering the Underwriting process. If the member is uncontrollable and escalates the tone of your dialogue, please
refer to policy titled: [Explicit/Offensive/Harmful Language](docs/Policies/Explicit%20Language)
