# Accurate Invoicing Point System

### \*Effective Immediately 12/04/2024

CCC is now implementing a point system for Invoicing @CCC Payables Department to
maximize the team's efficiency and further optimize payment turnaround times.

We have been experiencing contractors submitting duplicate claims, premature claims, failing to follow Careplan
dates, prorating inaccurately, and other such impurities. Any imperfect invoices will be assessed Bad Points.

- Duplicate: <Highlight color="#ff2600">2 Bad Points</Highlight>
- Advanced Billing: <Highlight color="#ff2600">1 Bad Point</Highlight>
- Disregarding Careplan Date: <Highlight color="#ff2600">0.5 Bad Point</Highlight>
- Incorrect Proration: <Highlight color="#ff2600">0.5 Bad Point</Highlight>
- Perfect Submission: <Highlight color="#25c2a0">0.5 Good Point</Highlight>
