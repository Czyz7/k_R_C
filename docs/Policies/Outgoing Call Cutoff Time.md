# Outgoing Call Cutoff Time

### \*Effective Immediately 07/22/2024

<br></br>

:::danger Please be advised, your cutoff time for placing Outgoing calls is 8pm PST.

Kindly refrain from making calls beyond this time.

:::

<br></br>

Incoming calls are automatically directed to voicemail after 6pm PST. You are given a two-hour grace period from 6pm to
8pm PST to complete any unfinished matters.

While we greatly appreciate everyone's dedication and effort, it has come to our attention that some team members have
been placing calls well past 9pm. In order to maintain a structured and professional appearance for our members, we must
establish a cutoff point. If you have placed the call prior to 8pm, there is no limitation regarding duration. Just no new calls
initiated past that cutoff.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Let's continue to uphold the high standards of customer service and
professionalism that CCC is known for.
