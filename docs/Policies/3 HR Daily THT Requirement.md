# 3 HR Daily THT Requirement

### \*Effective 12/30/2024

Please be advised, effective January 1, 2025, Housing Case Managers (HCM) are required to produce a minimum
Total Handle Time (THT) of 3 Hours per business day.

(MDX)

HCMs will be provided with a Monthly THT Report displaying their THT for each business day of the month. Days
will be marked BLUE, GREEN, ORANGE or RED depending on how many hours of THT an HCM has provided. Good
Points (GP) and Bad Points (BP) will be calculated at the end of each month, providing HCMs opportunities to grow
or shrink their Caseload Limit for the following month, depending on an individual's final point total the month
prior.

HCMs will be afforded a maximum of 6 BP without consequence to their Caseload Limit. Should an HCM score more
than 6 BP during any given month, CCC will be forced to decrease the HCMs Maximum Caseload by 5 members per
BP over 6 BP, beginning with the Sustaining portfolio (if applicable).

(MDX)

If an HCM encounters a call that does not yield any productive human interaction, they are required to report the
call to @Adrian Palasigue to deduct the time from the HCMs THT for that day. HCMs are not required to report the
call if the intention of the call was not to speak to a human, but to utilize an automated system to complete a task or
action. Failure to report calls with hold time that did not result in a meaningful conversation with a person past the
point of verification may be considered as THT Manipulation resulting in immediate termination of the offending
contractor's agreement. Please keep in mind, all calls are recorded and reviewed daily by CCC Quality Control.
