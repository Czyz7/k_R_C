# Member Deactivation/Reactivation Request

### \*Effective Immediately 12/17/2024

## Member Deactivation Request

Moving forward, @CCC Billing Department will AUTOMATICALLY DEACTIVATE members with UTC for 4 straight
Weekly Reports.

If you have not had any contact with the member for 4 weeks straight, expect for the member to
be deactivated by billing.

<br></br>

:::warning REMINDER:

Do not confuse **"`Deactivation`"** with **"`Disenrolled`"**.

- When a member is _`Deactivated`_, they are no longer a member of CCC.

- When a member is _`Disenrolled`_, they are no longer a member of IEHP or other Health Plans.

:::

<br></br>

:::info Common Reasons for Deactivation:

- **Unable to Contact (UTC)**: Must be unreachable for 90 consecutive days from most recent communication. If
  communication is made, 90 day period resets. Phone, Text and Email messages count as communication
- **Redirection**: Member requests redirection to another program or provider
- **Disenrolled**: Member no longer enrolled with healthcare provider
- **Relocation**: Member moved to another State or County
- **Duplicate Services**: Member's household member is already being assisted by CCC

## Member Reactivation Request

All Reactivation Requests must be tied to a recorded call which will be reviewed by
Underwriting for approval.

Please assist @CCC Underwriting Department to efficiently track the call by providing
relevant details using the template below.

It is important to inform your members that they will be deactivated, resulting in the loss of their Security Deposit
Voucher with CCC, if they do not establish contact with you at least once per month.

If contact with the member is reestablished after being deactivated, you may submit the following email for Reactivation:

### Requirements

:::tip Underwriting will review the request for the following:

1. **Verbal Engagement**: Ensure that you have verbally engaged in conversation with the member within the last
   30 days and have made extensive notes on Actionable Items from the discussion. Text Messages are NOT
   considered Vergal Engagement. You are encouraged to copy and paste RingCentral's AI Notes from your
   Verbal Engagement conversation.

2. **Active Notetaking in CP**: DO NOT request re-activation without updating the case notes in CP. Clear and
   detailed notation from your most recent conversation with the member is crucial for efficient re-activation.
   Failure to notate may result in the assessment of Bad Points by Underwriting. Case Managers will be
   evaluated on their ability to exercise Active Notetaking.

3. **Template Completion**: Always include the Member’s Full Name, ID Number and Reason for Re-activation. You
   may be assessed Bad Points for failure to complete the Required fields of the template.

4. **Submission**: DO NOT submit Reactivation Requests to @CCC Billing Department any longer. You will now be submitting Reactivation Requests to @CCC Underwriting Department.
